## Welcome
The **OWASP Universidad Politécnica de Yucatán Student Chapter** is a community of students passionate about cybersecurity, application security, and privacy.  
Our mission is to promote awareness, education, and hands-on learning about secure software development practices and the broader cybersecurity ecosystem.  

We organize talks, workshops, and collaborative projects to help students and the local community gain real-world skills in security, guided by OWASP’s global initiatives.  

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced student in technology, you are welcome to join and contribute.
